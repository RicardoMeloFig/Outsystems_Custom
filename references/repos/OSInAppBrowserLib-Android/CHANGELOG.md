# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.2]

### Fixes

- Send the `BrowserFinished` event from `onDestroy`, so it is no longer lost when the WebView is closed while the app is in the background. Previously the event was only sent from `onStop`, which Android skips when `finish()` is called on an already stopped activity, leaving the browser closed without notifying the app and blocking any new browser from opening until app restart ([RMET-5394](https://outsystemsrd.atlassian.net/browse/RMET-5394)).

## [2.0.1]

### Fixes

- Explicitly grant `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and `FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` when launching the photo/video capture intents from the WebView file chooser, required for Android 18's implicit URI grant restriction ([RMET-5241](https://outsystemsrd.atlassian.net/browse/RMET-5241)).

## [2.0.0]

### Fixes

- Isolate WebView local storage and cookies from the main app by default on Android 28+ [RMET-4918](https://outsystemsrd.atlassian.net/browse/RMET-4918)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- WebView storage is now isolated by default on Android 28+. Apps that need to share the main app WebView's `localStorage` or cookies must set `isIsolated` to `false`.

## [1.6.2]

### Fixes
