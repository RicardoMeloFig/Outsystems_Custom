## Overview

The Outsystems-hybrid-provision hosts the installation setup for the self-hosted version of outsystems ODC product.

Outsystems-hybrid-provision product is a low-code application development platform that enables your applications and data to host on your infrastructure (private cloud or on-premises). This Hybrid Low-Code Platform, a next-generation application development platform designed for enterprises that need the speed of low-code development with the control of on-premises data management.

Unlike fully cloud-hosted platforms, this solution offers the flexibility to run critical workloads on your infrastructure, while seamlessly integrating with cloud-based services for centralized control, updates, and monitoring.

It supports both Openshift and Kubernetes. However, the build and deploy of the applications will still remain with Outsystems ODC. ODC Portal and ODC Studio work together, making it quick to get the tools you need to develop and deploy your apps.

Before you can use ODC Studio, download it from the ODC Portal and login to your Outsystems tenant.
